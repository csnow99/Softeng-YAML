This project is a cloud base web page that was done with the help of Amazon Web Services (AWS). This website gives a user an opportunity to make decisions in a group with ease. Let’s say that a user wants to pick a movie to watch with their friends. The user can create a Choice called “Movie to Watch” with a description and have Alternatives of movies that their friends can select. Then everyone in the group would be able to vote on the Alternatives of the movies that the user created. In addition, the people with the special link for this Choice can write feedback to any of the Alternatives of the movies that the group is trying to pick. At any point any member of the group is able to complete the choice and select the final alternative. This final alternative would be then shown on the website and no one would be able to vote or post feedback or complete the choice. 
Another feature of this Choice System is the admin page that looks over every single choice and has the ability to delete choices past a certain date as they might be stale.

A demo of the website you could see with the link below:
